## To be implemented features / fixes ##

  * ~~~a better way to define low level functions (eg. writebits), pin numbers and ht1632c class instantiating)~~~
  * attribute for putchar (bold, underline, italic)
  * ~~~support for bitmaps~~~
  * ~~~support for fonts other then 5x7, 8x8~~~
  * proportional fonts
  * ~~~vertical scrolling~~~
  * ~~~text only printing function (thru wiring Print)~~~
  * ~~~fix benchmark (it's inaccurate!)~~~
  * ~~~more examples~~~
  * ~~~better commented code~~~
  * support for Sure Electronics non multiplexed CS display models (eg. 24x16 and 32x8)
  * ~~graphic primitives (eg. line, rectangle, circle, rectangle, ellipse)~~
  * transition effects (as commercial led signs)

## For future use / code reuse ##

  * write a library with the same functions for non ht1632 diplays (eg. 64x32)
  * ~~~compatibility for Leaflabs Maple (ARM STM32 "Arduino")~~~
  * ~~~compatibility for chipKIT Uno32 (PIC32 "Arduino")~~~
  * support for sprites (thru native wiring Sprite library?)
